Sometimes, I face problems uploading my files through Cpanel. If the File size is big, then it becomes worse.
This is how I came up with this idea which allows me to upload files without opening my Cpanel.

Description:
1. A fast way to upload your files to the server without opening your Cpanel.
2. Jquery file upload and PHP unzip;
3. Easy user interface.
4. No installation, unzip this file once and let it do the further UnZzip Works for you.
